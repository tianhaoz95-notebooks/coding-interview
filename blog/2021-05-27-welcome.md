Hi all! Welcome to my notebook for coding interviews.

I created this notebook to note down the good-to-knows from participating in the weekly LeetCode competitions.

There are many repositories, websites and YouTube videos for LeetCode solutions or tutorials.

This notebook is slightly different in that it's more opionionated towards what makes a better software engineer instead of a better interviewee.

You should be prepared to disagree with some of my views or implementations.

In general, this notebook focuses more on:

* The process of navigating through under-defined situations with only the basics instead of taking advantage of any higher level templates.
* Readability of the code instead of performance as long as the complexity is the same.

This notebook consist of 3 parts:

* LeetCode solutions.
* Coding interview tips.
* Blogs.
